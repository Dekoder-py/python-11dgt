= Introduction to variables & data types

A variable is a container that holds data. Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't have to specify the type of data in a variable, and that data type can change later on.

== Data types
* Integer: any whole number (a number without a decimal point), positive or negative
* Float: any number with a decimal point, positive or negative
* Boolean: True or False (case-sensitve) 
* String: anything surrounded by quotes (" " or ' ')

== Defining a variable
To define a variable, you pass a name for the variable and a value for the variable:
[,python]
----
my-var = 'This is a variable that holds a string'
number = 19
bool = True
floaty = 1.2
----

== Changing the value of a variable
You can change the value of any variable.
