= Introduction to variables & data types

A variable is a container that holds data. Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't have to specify the type of data in a variable, and that data type can change later on.

== Data types
* Integer: any whole number (a number without a decimal point), positive or negative
* Float: any number with a decimal point, positive or negative
* Boolean: True or False (case-sensitve) 
* String: anything surrounded by quotes ("" or '')
